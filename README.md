## Warmup Exercise: Pet Shop Simulation
### Instructions:
You are building a simple pet shop simulation using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript. You will create classes to represent different types of pets and their actions. The goal is to practice using classes, inheritance, and method overriding.

Tasks:
Create a Base Class: Define a Pet class with the following:

Properties: name, age (passed into the constructor).

Methods:
1. constructor: Initializes the name and age.
2. speak: A method that returns "Some sound" (This will be overridden in the subclasses).

Create Subclasses: Create two subclasses of Pet:

- Dog:
Override the speak method to return "Woof!"
- Cat:
Override the speak method to return "Meow!"

Test the Classes: Create instances of Dog and Cat, and call their speak methods to see the output.
